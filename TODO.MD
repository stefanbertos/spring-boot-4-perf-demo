ERROR: Failed to install ArgoCD

docker compose - grafana dashboards doest display data, most porably not the same as in helm lets fix first the helm and then export it

implement functionality in perf-tester ui - and remove rest swagger ui
make better ui design, with most moderns principles, make sure to use ui library  or create internal ui component library for button, link, menu, table, dialog based on some material design or so, in future if i want to build a second ui i would use the libraries

put grafana, prometheus dashboards as iframes into perf tester

add possibility to upload test templates and maintanance

add integration into jira to create a automatic ticket

add some tool to guarrail quality in perf-ui similar like checkstyle, pmd, sonar etc so the rules are enforced and add standard react ts rules as default

add external api or enhance the current one so as well some other automation tool can call the perf tester like robo framework etc and perform the test, get results etc
