grafana dashboards are wrong for

the e2e performance on rancher desktop kubernetes is only 40tps what is wrong?

remove rest swagger ui

put grafana, prometheus dashboards as iframes into perf tester

add possibility to upload test templates and maintanance

add integration into jira to create a automatic ticket

add external api or enhance the current one so as well some other automation tool can call the perf tester like robo framework etc and perform the test, get results etc

use select for update, limit, skip and proper annotations
